aiden said: hey all. I wanted to report a bug that I found on ul a long time ago and that I found out still works on this version as well.  there is a bug where you can quickly drop an item like a gift, then press your left or right arro key very fast as you press delete and then the item will stay in your hand as well as be dropped on the ground, so you can use that item and pick up the item you dropped. its like you didnt lose that gift at all, however you got what was inside the gift anyways. I thaught I would bring that one to your atention for the future version.  enjoying the nvgt update so much so far though

Jewel said: hi! first of all, thank you so much for your hardwork in creating this game. I have one suggestion. I don't know if it is already implimented. If yes, please ignore this message. my suggestion is regarding public maps. when a player or a group of players create a map and wants it to be public, it's only after getting permisson from a staff can they do so. this helps making public maps safe and free from errors. for instance, i am trapped in a public map called india tour i can not teleport or do anything else. may be it is because of the map code error
rishi said: add a bengali language channel too. 
netnapa said: Where can I buy a pillow?
Darkness said: I have a suggestion, how about making it possible to specify coordinates where you don't want it to rain, for example, 50 100, and it will rain at other coordinates?
Darkness said: O I'm knows, I mean, for example, you put on the map that there's a sound like rain like it's on the roof, but it would be cool if you could specify it on separate coordinates
Darkness said: Brutal thanks.
jazzyjennifer said: when in the survival store. at the mall. you can't here foot steps. when walking.
aiden said: another bug I found.  if you join a team, your team flag doesnt read out to chat, you have to log out and back in adn then it will say what team you are in. it should  give your chats the team flag when you join but you must restart for that to take effect

luis said: suggestion for the game: on things that can be activated with enter, a time delay should be added to prevent spamming of the item, for example, certain item taker items. that way, people won't be constantly spamming that. same thing with things that produce sound when activated. not sure if many people will like this but whatever. I feel it is necessary.

fifi said: Hi, admin, I want to ask, when Rishi moves an item to the initial position by pressing alt home, why does Rishi's connection lag so much? I mean, pink lost. Do you know the problem?
fifi said: but ping rishi is normal, 200 something
rishi said: no. my internet isn't slow. the problem is happening only in case of trying to sort items. when i am pressing alt home on something, the game is freezing and then kicking me off the server. but while killing animals and others everything remains fine

rishi said: my inventory i still cannot sort, when ever i am pressing alt down or up arrow, or alt home or end, it is just giving that sorting sound, and then my game is crashing and items are getting back to the previous position. wander what is wrong, or it wasn't properly updated or something.
rishi said: i am able to sort, then  for moment that item is in that position. just imagine i press alt home on the clay and move it on the top of my inventory.  so next when i will open inventory and see clay on the top, i will use it once and then it's position disappears, including the game lag and when i restart my client then it simply changes it's position back to where it was before
rishi said: sure, that sucks, all my inventory is unsorted from the bottom. like i wanted to make pots but wasn't able to put it up at all.

aiden said: I think you should add a feature to where  when you download clients it auto extracts and fixxes everything for you so you can just open the game again and not have to do anything else. it would be helpful
Robert said: Welcome. I think it would be very useful to do a kind of self -proof for new versions, that is, if you open the game and it has an update, announces you and just press an EP button, download the update. Update to unload and run directly. I saw something like this in other games and it's very useful
catalin said: Feedback! Update the message of the day, and add another 50000000 to Dino! Thank you and Have Funn!
catalin said: I say this, because the version has changed, I don't know why you are so hostile ...
catalin said: I didn't say anything wrong, and you shouldn't upset the players, I'm giving you feedbacks
catalin said: I congratulate you, because you did something so super!
catalin said: It is good to receive feedback, and stimulate players with money, are determined to fight more
catalin said: 100000000 for Dino, it is more than fair!

aiden said: the motor botes are pritty broken. first of all. the motor bote doesnt move at all when i start moving it forward. the second thing is when you try to exit and its running, it says your motor cycle must be stopped, not motor bote. and third, when you  use the horn, it plays a very loud horn sound that  will not stop at all even when you release the key. so even if you go to the main menu that horn sound will still be playing, you have to go out and go back in to the game

netnapa said: I would like to have 50peak_potion_of_dirtyness for sale in the shop.paid_store
aiden said: ok. so  the freezing bug is as follows. you need to teleport to the same place more then one time. for example, if you focus teleport with alt v, then  teleport to the cozey house,  and then after you teleport you quickly hit backspace again and  teleport to the same place again, that's when the game breaks
aiden said: so the motor botes are pritty broken here. I purchessed one, and when I went into the bote,   I pressed enter to start it, the motor started, but when I pressed up arro to speed the bote up, the bote didnt move at all, no matter how fast I was going, in adition, when the bote is on and you try and get out, it should say the bote must be off, however, it says that the motorcycle should be turned off. and last but not  least, when you use the horn on it, the horn doesnt stop until you restart your client

rishi said: the adding announcement of position while moving item is very good move. but you know what? my item sorting problem remains the same wander why.  i tried to move water poutch from the bottom to slitely upwards. it nicely announced while moving that item up, but when i closed the inventory and reopen it again, not only it got back to the position where it was before, but  lagged my client according to the ping prospective. then i had to close the game and log in again. as it is happening with only me, so i think i should redownload the fresh coppy and extract the hole game to see if it works well.
aiden said: hello, there is another bug I wish to report. if your partner is watching a player in the game, and you decide to teleport to your partner, you will teleport to where ever  your partner is looking at someone. for example. if fifi is my partner and fifi looks at patricus, and I teleport to fifi with the ring, I will teleport to patricus and even if I stop looking, I have been told that I will still be in the same place as patricus. this is a pritty big one because you can teleport to anyone you want as long as your partner is looking at them
aurelian said: hey i founded a bug. this could be solved by adding a restriction for putting paid items in boxes, or packs. the bug is az follows. i can ware an armor and put it in a box. and wen the  armor broke, bring it out from box and use it. rofl

deathdogg said: sometimes, after a mob dies, the sound for that mob won't stop playing. THe sounds won't stop playing, even after you switch maps. I have heard bikes and cars inside the cozy house, and robots that died inside the boss chest room. So sounds don't always die with their source.

amber said: Hello Admins,
I want to report something that might be a bug or an NVGT issue. I’m not completely sure, but it seems like a glitch. Whenever we update something in the map, the game lags for a few seconds.
For example, while I was creating my map, I added a door and updated it. As soon as I did that, the game window lagged for a while. So I wanted to ask — is this a known bug or some kind of issue with the server that causes the game to lag temporarily?
Thank you.
amber said: o So how do I fix this? Could it be a network error? Could this be happening because of the internet, since this game is online?
amber said: So okay, I will change my router and see.  np admin for help
rishi said: hay, create an account in ultra world tt server? or i can join with my partner's account there

amber said: Hello Admin,
I am developing a map for game. Previously, I faced a problem where the game would freeze after map   updates, but that has been resolved—I realized it was a network issue.
Now, when I try to exit to the main map, I see this error message:
You can’t do this
This happens even though there’s no other issue. I just wanted to   how to fix it.
amber said: Okay, it is working, thanks.

Apparently the problem has not been solved with the dinosaur, that is, you can continue to go to the dinosaur through Friendship.

The only thing I want to say is that I didn't help him in any way to get there

Robert said: Welcome. I have a suggestion, when someone presses one of the staff members when writing /staff to take it to the box where private messages can be written
Neex said: feedback: Ayo guys, please in future update, make grenade just a bit faster, thank you, have a nice day/evening.
Robert said: That is, after you press Enter on a staff to appear the field for message
Robert said: Not. So you write Slash Staff and members appear. When you press a member who is online you can send them a direct message
Robert said: Thank you. And please, create a buffer just like chat, private messages and more, but it is with the staff conversation. I find it very useful for a very simple reason: if the person who writes you leaves from your computer, he will not know if you have answered or not

Robert said: I don't know if you understand what I meant. I show you right away
Robert said: speaker test subMenu, by text, Press left arrow to check your left speaker, space to check center, and right arrow to check your right speaker. Press escape or enter to go back to the main menu. Press enter to continue
Robert said: OK. When I come from work I will check your Voice. If you want to tell me something else tell me in private because now I go to work and I will surely lose messages
rishi said: master_santu is jailed, for how long? and never new for using potion also someone can be jailed. if it is spammy then you guys could ask him to stop or warn him throo pm or warnings. he doesn't understand english much, so may be he misunderstood or something.
fifi said: admin, how long will Santu be in jail?
fifi said: seriously, 2 days?
rishi said: he is not aware of pc things too much, and he says he drank only one xp potion, but he didn't do anything else. and after he got jailed also cozy house was that noisy with spam, i think there ois some misunderstandings,
fifi said: But you can move Santu to another place, maybe he won't hear the local message
rishi said: release him, he first of all didn't do anything, second, if he did that was unintentional. i told him to not to do any activities in cozy house. he said he was only asking about xp potion about why it appears in inventory as 1 after buying 50 potion. and he drank all the potions in lindo town. not in the cozy house. kiwi was there, you can ask him.
fifi said: Hey admin, but Santu was in Lindow Town at that time
fifi said: How is he supposed to make noise here if he's somewhere else?
rishi said: and if he drank potions in lindo town 50, how do you consider it as spam, that doesn't make sense at all, in cozy house he didn't do anything at all.
rishi said: i also drank 50 kanadiga's potion or more, for having more energy, so i wasn't ever warned for that, how cn it be happen like that. come on, it is good to jail someone after having proper evidence. i think i did that in cozy house but wasn't warned. let's not be that unfair without having proper information about the crime. if a developer is relaxing in lindo town and someone spams near him by drinking potion, either he should move away or change his map. and the cozy house is always noisy, everyone is doing something over there time to time. imagine i sit there and start making pots, that also questionable point weather to consider it as spam or not.
fifi said: you have to check who is making the noise before writing the player's name, make sure whether the master santu is at that location or not, if there isn't but you write his name, you are just abusing your own power
fifi said: I told you, Santu is in Lindow Town. Once again, lindow, town. Not at your location
rishi said: so suddenly the reason got change? wlmao, before it was for drinking potion i think.
rishi said: but he admits that he only drank one xp potion in the lindo town. he didn't drink potions as per spam in cozy house at all. that's what he said, i wasn't online in that time to see, neither i have power to check. therefore i ask you guys to consider it as misunderstanding. this is a casual chillzone, it is not necesary to be harsh unless it is needed.
rishi said: aah thanks
rishi said: sorry for disturbing again. i forgot my tt account's password. is it possible to let me know the password now so that i could try logging in?

Moosavi said: "Hello dear administrators, good morning. There are several major bugs that need to be fixed as soon as possible. 
First, please fix the wand and add some beautiful spells to it. Also, remove the whistle from the shops. 
I also have a suggestion: please remove the game's stores so that players can have their own personal stores.
Additionally, please fix the item_carrier and box bugs as soon as possible. Players can cheat with these items and multiply their items."
 thanks for build a good game
Moosavi said: "And I have a small suggestion, I'd like to offer my help with the game's tasks. I can help fix bugs, assist players, and more. If possible, I'd like to be tested to see if I can be of use. I know there are many players who need help, and I'd be happy to stay in the game and assist them.
So, if it's possible, I'd like to be a  administrator, just like you, so I can help people in this great game. I'm a hardworking person, and you can test me to see if I'm capable. I'd love the opportunity to contribute to the game and help players."

alireza.m said: Hello and respect! I’m one of the people who recently joined this game. Compared to the games I’ve seen so far, this one is really great. There’s just one thing missing, which might even be considered an issue — every time we open the inventory, the items start arranging from the beginning. It would be better if the inventory opened from the same position it was last closed. I’ve seen this feature in some other games, and I think it’s a very practical one. Oh, and by the way, if possible, please add a language channel for Persian-speaking users as well. Thank you!

rishi said: suggestion, in case of ringing the bell of the bike, why do you need to stop and then ring, shift space could work instantly  even while moving. can't bike work like new stw bike system? another thing, although realisticly it sounds good. in car when we blow the horn, only the driver or owner can hear it. but beside other players cannot hear it that sucks. to make it car driving more realistic,  you should make the option so that other players should be able to hear the horns of the car. i can sense some noisy players will misuse of that feature, but for that jail and ban system  can be applied.

When my friend is online, he should be in the main map but instead of being there, the   ashu my friend is falling down in the map which I had deleted, that is, it is going into minus. So?

when the residential area is reopened, will the construction menu be disabled?

dlv said: yes, i hope so
Sango said: It would be really nice if there was a command to open all gifts at once, that way there isn't a bunch of spamming of the packspace or space keys. It would also reduce the spam from other players if they're in the cozy house, etc.
Sango said: It would be a wonderful feature if somehow markers could be implemented for making maps. It would help with marking areas where builders would like to put things, possibly. Perhaps there could be a list of markers that you can look back at. I have no idea how this would be implemented, but it would be a really nice feature to have for building maps.
Sango said: May I know why that is?

Sango said: it would be awesome if we could grow plants to make potions, as well as different food recipes. Perhaps for a fee the player could have their own garden. There could be a nursery to buy different plants and seeds to make your own little garden.

deathdogg said: Only one locker can be placed in rosehaven house. I'm not sure if that's intended behavior, and I don't mind sharin with my partner but just thought I would let you know
deathdogg said: When adding stuff to locker, it kicks you out of the menu every time you add something into the locker, instead of presenting you with the get and store options again, making it so you have to type the code in every time you have to store something. If you have a ton of stuff, it could take ages. Suggestion to fix this issue

If I don't like something in the house, can I update it? Please give me information about using something not in the build. Because what people do is they spam around the house or by making maps, so that's why I'm asking if I can make updates in the house? Don't worry, I know how to make maps so there won't be any problem, but I'm still asking for clarification.

TubshterBratBird said: hi guys, just to report if you try to store certain foods into the fridge, it won't store them, even though it tells that you stored it. example, if I try to store 30 big chocolate bars in the fridge, and I look in the fridge, and it doesn't store them in there. hopefully it can be fixed in the future.

fifi said: how too, become my name, Hi fifi. Welcome to down town shopping centre. Here you can place your store and go shopping in other stores.
amber said: Game: Ultra World
Version: 2.46
Date: 18 October 2025
Hello admin, I found a bug with the fridge system.
When I store all my N-tier food items in the fridge, those same items still appear again in the Store list, even though I have nothing left in my bag. For example, if I store all my French fries, they still show again, and I can keep storing them repeatedly. It should say something like “You have nothing left to store,” but it doesn’t.
Also, when I store a single item (like 1 French fries), the fridge sometimes shows empty when I check it later. It says, “You look at the fridge, but there’s nothing inside,” even though I just stored something. But if I click Get all items, then I can see the items coming back.
So the Get option works fine for all items, but the Store option and single-item display are not updating properly.
Expected:
• 
After storing all items, they should disappear from the Store list.
• 
After storing a single item, it should show inside the fridge.
Please check and fix this. If this is not a bug, kindly tell me how to fix it.
Thanks,
Amber
amber said: If you want any video explanation of the game, you can tell me and I will send it.
catalin said: suggestion, please allow more items to be added to the microwave
catalin said: also, I have a problem too: I put the fridge in the wrong place, and now I can't destroy it! can someone help me
gemer said: Good day, administrators and developers. I found a bug that when I want to enter a residential area with a vehicle, I can't do it because the game thinks I'm in pvp, even though that's not the case, this only happens in a vehicle.
gemer said: But can I park my vehicle near the house
gemer said: ok, thanks
aiden2 said: hi, there's another bug, i'm not sure if its been fixxed, but I will say it anyways. if you  are in a 2d map and your y is grater then 0, it will still say 0. lets say I built a staircase at  x 10 and  then it goes up 10 tiles. if I walk up that stair case, instead of saying 10 10, it  says 10, 0 still.
aiden said: wow, I just realised that the 2d bug was fixxed, sorry for the last admintell, pleas disreguard it
Sergey said: Hmm, why don't make it so houses are automatically built by picking free coordinates? On one hand, that's kinda strange, but on the other, we could then have a massive, even auto-expanding map, and live in our homes without issues, no matter how many free spots are left.
netnapa said: I want it Don't break up with my partner
moonrose said: hello good day excuse me Is it possible to help me? I have misplaced household items such as the refrigerator, is it possible to remove my house from where it is so that I can put another house in this area? I apologize again.
netnapa said: I want to separate from my partner.
netnapa said: He's not online. For several days now, I have been wanting someone who is online often.
moonrose said: I have put things in the wrong places. For example, my fridge is here. door between fridge and kitchen

rishi said: this item sorting bug is getting serious now. now along with me, alvarez, master santu, and all the indians having that issue. now you should take it seriously and fix this. otherwise everyday new items are being added so we dont have any option to sort the items properly. with cherry also that item sorting bug is happening
rishi said: now i think i can sense the cause of it. alvarez just before sometimes moved his large armer plate and it worked well. but now after buying some weapons and i gave him some items, he is also having the same item sorting bug. so that may make a sense, after a certain numbers of items in inventory that item sorting starts to lag. and actually the most annoying thing is  even though it shows it changes position, but at the end it comes back at it's previous position. when i logged in  and had few items, then i also could sort items nicely.

Jewel said: what do you mean? is the temperature enabled? and i have a question. do the ac fans and steam work? if not, can you remove those items from the store?
AshleighPiccinino said: should add police car to this game for staff use!

If you get attacked and the shots are reduced to less than before, for example it drops to 200 shots, you can remove large_armor from wearing and equip it again without the amount of large_armor in your bag being undecreased, you will definitely get 1020 shots.

rishi said: i think w key is good for that. although it is for checking the player tracked location. but  just make an option have a single tracking option. so you cannot track zone and a player at the same time. or need to think to have a comfortable key ffor it. at least that key isn't alt n for sure,

nuttawat said: "Dear developers, administrators, or managers,
I would like to propose two new features for map creation.
First, the ability to create doors that can be walked through and left open, simulating a real-world door.
Second, the option to assign unique URLs to specific coordinates on the map. For example, a URL for a radio room at 30:50:0 and a different URL for a bar at 101:300:500. This would allow for multiple, location-specific URLs within a single map, rather than one URL for the entire map as it currently is.
Thank you for your consideration."

dronzer said: hi admins, I have a suggestion about auction system, some bids get really anoying some times. whatever amount is entered, can be passed by some players with only 1 coins, for instence, if someone bid 25000000, or 30000000, the other player bid 1 coins extra, and take all the items, so my idea is, to make a system where every next bid will be either 10% amount of last bid, or 25%, or whatever you think appropriate. thanks.

charry said: i would suggest when married people will get the same amount of xp for both side and if the partner is offline they will get the full pay if partner is offline
blinds said: can you guys try to fix the xp system for married people? it is normally that the person that does no work gets more xp, but the person who works gets verry little xp
and it is a problem, lots of players are complaining about it
gabriel said:  hi my brutals, I have a suggestion regarding the sharing of brutal xp between married brutal couples. if possible, if you guys could make it so that we can both get equal amounts of xp, or make it so that whoever is doing the hard brutal work leveling and the other partner is not helping they would get less reinforcements than the one doing all the hardcore work. because currently, the partner that isn't doing anything to help level would get more reinforcements than the one that was doing all the hard brutal work, so it just seems unfair to me. Also, even if the partner is not online at the time your leveling, you still don't get the full amount of xp as though you were a single person. and even when the partner comes online later on, of course they won't get the reinforcements from when one of us were brutally leveling our asses off,  while the other is offline. my appologies if this is long, i'm just trying to make my point clear. thanks very much for an awesome brutaltastic  game!

Nyx said: Hello, I'd like to get a devorsing. Thanks.

rishi said: bug! in the same map when someone watches you then the player who is watching disappears from the f5 menu from the person who is being watched.
rishi said: suggestion! add an option to enable/disable jokes or such things, as staffs playes some horrible sound sometimes which some player may not want to hear in that time. but some may like it as well. just like when i was building map, already here was noise of fireworks and all, moreover some staffs were having fun sending those growels. definitely players might were enjoying it. but some times that becomes irritating too. specially in the midnights lol. so that also should be player's personal preference. i consider myself a bit serious gamer, but i also understand this is good for some players to have them. therefore i asked it to let players choose.

istek said: I will tell something about weapons. Maybe the rockets and rpgs, I think rockets, are breaking the weapons. Now none of weapons works if the creature is far than 5 steps, like if its 6, the weapon, rocket launcher also doesn't hit, same for m152, its also get broken anyway. Try disabling it and lets see the result.
istek said: yes share please, I know because I faced with issue before.

rishi said: now as this game is building a big staff panel, you guys please disable the sound+announcement notification of who is dev or admin or ast. that players already can see by checking /staff. otherwise after a server restart everyone is logging in and giving such sound is annoying sometimes. it was fine as long as 10 players playing it. but now this is building a nice playerbase, so seriousness also should be by another level ahead.

dronzer said: Hi dear administrators of this game, I hope you're all doing great. I'm reaching out for help. Unfortunately, after the recent update, my game isn't working as it used to. Every menu is freezing my game, from the exit menu to /help menue teleporter menu, auction bid confirmation, and the buying and selling menu. Basically, it's like nothing works in any menu where I have to select an option with 2 or more choices. My game doesn't respond, and it also takes too much time to open the executable file. The issue isn't limited to in-game the main menu, select music, and account setup menu are also affected. I'm finding it extremely difficult to play with these issues, and it's almost impossible to survive without functional menus. I can't easily visit public and challenge maps. I kindly request that you look into my issue. Thank you 
dronzer said: yes I did, I redownloaded the game, restarted my pc 2/3 times, set my power plan to best performince, and also added in the exclusion list. 
dronzer said: see this, after clicking on help menue. Ultra World version 2.47 (Not Responding)  unknown  focused
dronzer said: even after redownloading it was working fine, but everything messed up after this latest update, I don't know what's wrong, now what should I do now, cause it's actually impossible to play without those features, I will luse the essence of the game. the only thing will be remaining to chat.

Robert said: Welcome. I'm coming again with a suggestion: It would be good to have an order to find out the moderators of the team. Command of type /teammods. Why? Because it would be easier to be able to see who is the moderator without exploring the whole list. And one more thing, it would be nice if moderators couldn't buy stuff from the teamstore
BarryAllen said: I expect any developer to contact me urgently via PM. We need to talk and discuss. You can't escape. You must answer my questions.
Dinac said: ok first idea is about houses, since it is very hard to get to your house like this you can make a big building with a lift which can take you to the flor where your house is quickly 
Dinac said: one more thing which i just saw: if you press arrow keys very fast you can walk very fast. I think you should disable that because it opens place for some cheating 
SilentMage said: add dice set to the game. a box containing dice and dice cups.
SilentMage said: and the dice have different number of sides. 6 to 20.

Dinac said: when i fire my shotgun, the sound of shot echoing and slide wracking does not follow me, but it stays on the tile where i fired a shotgun. It creates problems when i am fireing and walking because it makes the sound late behind me

ahmed.mokhtar said: The problem is that when I press the lighter to light the stove, it does not work. Also, when I press the gas button, I get trapped inside the stove and cannot get out.
ahmed.mokhtar said: Yes, my friend, I open the nob  but then I get locked inside and I cannot find the button to close the nob
Robert said: Hello. Sorry for the trouble. Could you tell me the administrative differences between team moderator and leader? I mean, I understand and it's logical, the leader can do anything, but the moderator?

kiyarash said: Dear developers of the game  uw,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing as a passionate fan of your game, which I truly admire for its creativity, design, and overall experience. I would like to kindly request that you consider adding support for Windows 7 in a future update.
Many players, including lots of my friends, still use Windows 7 for various reasons, and being able to enjoy your beautiful game on this platform would mean a lot to us. I understand that supporting older operating systems can be challenging, but even partial compatibility or a lightweight version would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and for creating such an amazing game. I look forward to your response and hope for a positive consideration.
Warm regards,

troyanda said: Hello, there is no sound or description in the corpse of a person.
jasper said: Hi there! 👋
First off, I just want to say I really enjoy playing your game — it’s full of charm and creativity! I did notice a small bug I thought you might want to know about: when I eat bowl of ice cream, the bowl doesn’t get added to my inventory afterward. It feels like the character eats the ice cream with the bowl 😄
To make things more realistic and fun, maybe you could add a dirty bowl to the inventory after eating, instead of a clean one — so players have to wash it with water to reuse it. I think that would add a nice touch of immersion!
Thanks for all your hard work — looking forward to see future updates! 🍦✨

NightCreature said: pleas modify the gun system.
currently, there are lot of guns that we can buy at the mall.
but, most of them are useless.
according to my point, only m152, m234, roket launger, and nack nk decimater are good for hunting/fighting.
but, you can impliment a grate shot gun, or,
a snyper that have more than 100 tile rainge with a vertual camera.
and much more.
plus, a grenade llaunger with 50 or 80 amunition.
currently, we can't use 2 guns at the same time.
we have to reload every time when we get the gun to our hand or swich to other hand.
this is not verry ideal.
hoping to implement thees problums, specialy the reload issue,
thank you

troyanda said: Good evening, I have a proposal for you. My boyfriend and I have created a system consisting of a beach, a small island with a lighthouse, a city, a pine forest, and a hotel. We don't want this map to be public; we want it to be linked to one of your maps, either to a city or somewhere else. If you are interested in this idea, let us know and we will show you our world.

AshleighPiccinino said: Hello everyone. if you notice something doesn't have a description in your invintory, please pm it to Ariella. She's currently on the long task of adding descriptions for every item, and your help would make her job a lot easier.

amirali said: Hello! I’m Amirali, one of the active players and a map maker on the server. I’d like to apply for a short trial as an admin or assistant — maybe for about two weeks. During this time, I can help by reporting bugs, fixing issues on the maps, and assisting the team wherever needed. If it goes well, I’d be happy to continue. Thank you for considering my request!

11. Boss rules. After killing bosses, such as gods or other large monsters, you must leave the map. and make opertunities 
for other players to kill. No stealing kills. If you are caught doing so, or someone reports you, you will be sent to jail for a week.
 but  Ashishchhetri said to me 
  local chat from Ashishchhetri (Ashishchhetri): leave
at to enter the dinosaur cave, hit shift enter
Brownie said: At that time, I walked in and he told me to leave. I haven't done anything yet.

And the truth is, I never compete with other players, if I see someone there I'll leave.

I'm just telling you. I just know the battle isn't fair.  
You don't have to do anything.  I'm just telling you.

Robert said: And one more question, when do the Warnings reset? Or does it ever reset?
Robert said: Ok thx
Robert said: I propose that team leaders and teammod see when their team members last logged in, ie there should be a function where only team members can be checked. This way we will know who is active and who to rely on if we have to choose a responsible moderator

Robert said: Resolved thx
Robert said: I have a suggestion: If a member is eliminated, they should not be able to enter the team unless they are invited. Why? Because maybe that leader doesn't want to change the password, so if a member is eliminated, he can only enter with an invitation and if he later leaves the team and wants to come again, then he can enter with a password
Robert said: No, but currently if someone gets kicked out, they can log back in with their password

serennus said: did something go wrong with HP? I'm in R 102, I restarted client to fix the ghost chests, and somehow my health went from my previous max, 20100, to over a million?
Robert said: There is an error in the partner chat. Instead of a partner, it is a partnar
serennus said: I was killing some chests. This caused my R to go up, from 101 to 102. I also restarted to fix the ghost chest thing. I recently checked my health, to check my shots actually, and it said 1010200. It should actually be 20200, so an extra 990000 came from somewhere.
Robert said: For example Partnar Dialog
serennus said: my XP curve hasn't changed. And I had 20100 HP while in my apartment earlier, so it wasn't the update alone that did it, as I hit max while healing like 40 minutes ago.

Moren said: Dear administrators. I understand that you have a lot of things to do, and I would not like to distract. But I still want our maps to be tied to yours, i.e. we created our own little world from five maps. The largest are the city and the hotel, the others are just transitions. I would be grateful if you would consider this proposal.

ashu said: Dear staff, my car is stuck inside a wall. What happened is: I came to this residential area. As my car was entering the area, I checked the coordinates. They were 25, 700. I was thinking about how this road and this area looked. Because of that, I just stopped my car and got outside. But after viewing the map, I saw my car was stuck inside a wall. I can't reach the coordinate 25, 700, and I am stuck in coordinate 25, 699. So, my request is simply to bring my car to coordinate 25, 699.

nuttawat said: "Dear respected developers and any staff, administrators, or managers reading this,
Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide feedback. I would like to make one more suggestion.
I propose changing the keybinding for the command 'to see what is in front of or behind us' from Shift + Arrow to Alt + Arrow.
The reason is that the current binding (Shift + Arrow) conflicts with the jump command, which is Shift + Space. This conflict prevents us from being able to jump and move at the same time.
Currently, if we try to press Shift + Space (to jump) and Arrow (to move) simultaneously, the command Shift + Arrow interferes, and the character does not move as intended.
Changing the 'look' command to Alt + Arrow would resolve this conflict, allowing us to jump with Shift + Space while also moving with the arrow keys.
Thank you for your consideration."
officer_jonson said: hi, can i kik a player out of my house?
favas said: i am just chillin
nuttawat said: "Here is one more suggestion I would like to propose.
I suggest adding a 'Social App' to the in-smartphone options. In this app, we should have the ability to add anyone as a friend.
Additionally, I propose including a 'Send Item to Friend' feature. This would be for situations where we want to give an item to a specific person, but they are not in the same map as us.
Currently, if we use the auction, we risk having someone else take the item instead of our intended friend. This new feature would allow us to send the item directly to that friend.
This could be implemented via the smartphone app or through another menu, whichever you deem most appropriate.
Thank you very much."

Jewel said: Dear staff,
 [I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the recent introduction of the new door feature, specifically the ability for house/apartment owners to grant entry to others without requiring a code. This is a fantastic step towards creating a more convenient and welcoming community within the game.

Previously, the requirement for all guests to know and use a code, even if it could be changed, did raise some minor safety and privacy concerns for players. The new system effectively addresses this by allowing owners to proactively grant access, fostering a greater sense of ease and trust among players. Thank you for listening to feedback and implementing such a thoughtful improvement.

Building on this excellent enhancement, I would like to respectfully suggest a potential refinement for the door interaction system, if it aligns with your development plans and technical capabilities.

Currently, interacting with doors feels very much like a direct switch – pressing "enter" instantly moves the player to a location. My suggestion is to implement a more nuanced interaction:

Suggestion:

When a player approaches a door and presses "enter" to open it:
•  The door opens
 •  The player could then step through the doorway.
• you can set a time duration for the door openning time or else it will leave open until the player closes it.
This subtle change could create a more consistent and immersive interaction logic. It mimics real-world door behavior more closely, where there's a moment of opening, passage, and then closing, rather than an instantaneous teleport. I understand that development involves many considerations, and this is merely a suggestion offered with the utmost respect for your team's vision and workload. The new feature is already a significant improvement, and this idea is simply a thought on how it could potentially be even more robust.

Thank you again for your dedication to improving this game. I am genuinely excited to see how the game continues to evolve.

Sincerely,

Jewel

It's as if there's a broken area. I tried to fix it, but I couldn't. At first, I thought it wasn't a platform, but it is. When I saw that it was, I deleted the platform I had created. That's all I did. Then, I asked my girlfriend to walk around, and she couldn't hear anything either. But I can hear what she's doing from outside. What should I do?
Aayla said: hi i would like to make a suggestion of delivering food in the game. for example, having a room in the uw centre were you could deliver 5 cakes for 5000 coins.
shiam said: Hello uw staff community. I'd like to make a suggestion to add the feature to kick a player out of the house it might be done through our phone, or maybe you could add an item in the house hold shop called computer with some options for house and bank and stuff. I hope you'll consider my suggestion. thanks.

I believe, at the moment only team leaders can buy those in the team store, it'd be great if they could be added in the mall so we can just buy them as needed, so we don't have to bother the team leaders if we need friendship shperes. thanks for an awesome game!

I want to hear your conclusion, can our world be public? for example, from the ocean leading to another city, there may be a passage to our beach with a ship in the north of the map. Well, on to our world
Moren said: my maps have been reviewed by admins Darkness and NicoDiAngelo
Moren said: no, I'm not talking about competing for the best map. I want to make it so that players have access to my world. it was not in vain that we built, how did you look at all the maps, including the hotel, you must understand that a lot of work has been done
crazydog said: the nutrition machine in apartments doesn't work is there a reason for that
troyanda said: dear administration, how do you feel about cars being zoned. because that's how you can accidentally destroy someone's car without knowing it?
troyanda said: I'm not about that. I'm talking about people understanding where a car is located, so that it doesn't happen that a person accidentally destroys a car in the city,
Robert said: I have a suggestion: Add a team merge command that can only be used by team leaders. Sort of a request and accept or decline, just like the team invite. That way we won't have to bother you about that either. This should also contain explanations so that when merging teams it is known in advance who goes to which team
Dobby said: you should remove the reverb from the punching bag gym. if i go in there i can hear nothing.
charry said: t urm. what does this means when you say Game update:  Most of menus on the server has been changed to a mew and improved menu system. This menu system does not contain sounds and is not made for it. This system includes keys like Ctrl+F to find, Ctrl+G to go line, F3 / Shift+F3 to find next and previous of already searched string, Ctrl+C to copy etc.

BigBob said: perfect. got it. cheers

Fidget-Fanatic said: first of all, I don't appreciate people editing my maps without asking me first, darkness, I'm pointing at you. you could have handled it better, like making the map private until I came online to fix it. it was just 1 little mistake with a wall. I had to find out from someone else that someone was changing stuff in my map, a map that took 2 full days to build by the way. second of all, darkness, I don't appreciate your rude comment on me learning to build. I've been building on games since 2020, so you have no right at all to tell me what to learn and what to learn buddy. and last of all, developers, this has been a great game but I will not tollerate people treating me this way. feel free to delete my char because I will not be coming back. ps, learn to pick better staff. darkness is nothing but a drama causer. goodbye. thankyou to the nice people who helped me with this game. I don't want to leave but I'm not going to tollerate this jiggery pokery
troyanda said: good evening, and sometimes you couldn't add a little more sound to women's emotions
Robert said: Welcome. Any developer to fix this problem? By the gods, if you want to jump over the wall you can fall from a great height. is it ok like this Or it needs to be solved
Robert said: Well yeah, shouldn't that wall be in such a way that you can't get over it?

Robert said: I have a suggestion: If a member with warnings reports something or does something good for the game, be given a penalty reduction or a warning removed
Robert said: Yes but it would be interesting to have a way to time out that warning
Robert said: Ok and one more thing: When you restart the server, we always have to press enter to come back, that is, to be able to connect. A feature to allow automatic login would be useful. You will say that there is autologin, but for me, if I activate it and you restart the server, the game closes for me, that is, it exits the window
Robert said: Yeah I see, but I was thinking that good stuff needs to be proven, ie a problem report could be included, or a proven cheat, not a player coming in and saying something just to take away their warnings
troyanda said: good evening, I have a proposal regarding tents. and if they are added to the starting package, so that our beginners do not wander and have their own corner
BigBob said: I accidentally removed a good chunk of my house data, and are currently suspended in the air. I can not access invintory. Looking to rebuild the home from the ground up. A little mistake on my part. Troubleshoots?
BigBob said: Ah. I understand. However, I can not access the builder menu to paste said data. So, what could I do?
BigBob said: Talk about a silly perdicument. haha. Unfortunately I am stuck.
BigBob said: Could I possibly request a destruction of my house please? Sadly, my tiny mistake made it impossible to access the builder menu. Nothing of significance was present, just yet, I made the error while experimenting. I believe I am house 101 on the sunlight neighborhood.
BigBob said: Appreciate the assistance. Trial by fire, right? hahaha.
BigBob said: It will take me a few moments. :D 
NightCreature said: hello,
i really need to understand this clearly because this punishment makes no sense.
i got jailed for 1 week and 3 days for turning off pvp during a battle, but the truth is, the other player caused this, not me.

before i used the pvp excavator, i told him to wait and sent messages in local. he saw them and still kept chasing and attacking me like he didn’t care at all. i was trying to stop the fight in a fair way, but he ignored everything and just wanted to keep attacking.

the logs clearly show what happened:
NightCreature (NightCreature): wate
NightCreature is no longer pvp

and now i’m the one getting punished for that? how does that even make sense? he was the one who broke fair play first by attacking after i told him to wait.

the devs said i shouldn’t leave while fighting, but what was i supposed to do in that moment — just stand there and let him destroy all my safe cards while he ignored everything i said? i used the pvp excavator only because he didn’t stop attacking. i was the one playing fair here, not him.

this punishment is completely unfair, and i shouldn’t be the one blamed for trying to handle it the right way.

NightCreature said: hey,
i just wanted to say, it would be great if we could at least do something while we’re in jail. jail is really boring right now.

yeah, i get it — we’re put there as punishment, that’s fine. but doing absolutely nothing the whole time is just frustrating. we joined the game to *play*, not to stare at walls for a week.

maybe we could have some small tasks, mini-games, or even the ability to look around or watch other players while we wait. that would make the punishment feel more like part of the game instead of just being locked out completely.

NightCreature said: yeah, i get your point. it’s meant to be a punishment, not fun.
but honestly, just sitting there doing nothing doesn’t really make us think about what we did — it just makes us bored and frustrated.

maybe adding something small like a reflection task or limited stuff to do would still make it punishment, but at least keep players active instead of zoning out for days. that way it still feels like a consequence, not a waste of time.

NightCreature said: yeah, i get that. but at least we should be able to look at a player or something while we’re in jail.
it wouldn’t make it fun, but it’d still give us something to do instead of just staring at nothing the whole time.

TubshterBratBird said: hi guys, just a quick suggestion for maybe a future update. it seems if you mute a player that is also in the same team as you're in, you apparently still get the team chats from the person that you muted. would it be possible to make it so that even if you mute someone that you don't get along with and that person is also in the same team as you, that you won't even see their team chats?

dark-night said: Hello Admin everyone, today I have a proposal for creating a map. I wish that when I add tiles, I don't want the character to be negative for a smooth map creation experience.
For example:
tile:0:0:0:0:0:0:carpet6
If we move our character to this point, we will be able to step on the ground normally, but if we go to coordinates 1 or 2, that character will plummet and will cause the character to become negative. I would like to suggest that when we create a map, there will be some kind of system that allows the character to float above various surfaces. If, for example, we are at coordinates 000, if we walk to coordinates 1, 1, 0, which we did not put the ground on, we will not fall, we will be able to walk back to coordinate 000 as before.
This will enhance the game experience even more and this system can also make new players who have never created a map not confused about moving themselves
balashowri said: PLEAS MELP ME SIR 
dark-night said: I understand this point well, my friend, but map creation should be a smooth experience, not one where if we fall through the air, we have to manually move ourselves back up and continue map creation. I see that we should add an item specifically for map creation, such as an item that allows us to float exclusively over the map we own or where we are the Owner. I believe this item is absolutely necessary to be added for a better and more complete gaming experience.
I apologize that I have to use another game as an example to broaden the perspective. For example, the game SBYW has a 'contributor_suit,' which has various features that make map creation more fun and exciting

SunWukong said: Hi respected staff/developers. I want to ask related to how to increase reinforcement, how to increase reinforcement? Because as I experienced, it really increases reinforcement if you work in the dragon cave, because the XP you get is very small, even though I have drunk XP_potion, however, what I get is not as big as before when I played the ultimate life game. Please help, that's all and thank you. My best regards.
SunWukong said: OK, 1 more question. Does it work in this game? And what can I do, and where can I get recipes for cooking/crafting? Thank You.
SunWukong said: OK, thank you and sorry to disturb admin/developer activities.

semsem said: I want to understand now — when will I return?
semsem said: But my internet connection is weak. I'm here just to have fun, not for anything else.
If you don't release me now, I will quit the game along with the other members of my teams, because I'm innocent — the internet was the real reason, my friend.
semsem said: No, my friend, even after that it disconnected me at least three more times.
semsem said: Please answer me now. Let me return, and I promise this will not happen again — at least during the auctions.
semsem said: My friend, one day really makes a difference to me. I’m in the game just to have fun.
I apologize, and I promise this won’t happen again.
semsem said: I don’t understand this insistence, but I already told you — one day is difficult for me because I work, and this is my only free time.

Ariella said: uh what we should be allowed to build our tent?
artemis said: hi, i think that when people who are married share xp it should be that the person who killed gets full xp and the partner gets half of that value, cause when all xp is split, it makes it super hard to level and gain reinforcement
Archangel said: Hi. I want to suggest in marage that your experience is full for you killing it, and you get the total amount and like 25% or half is sent to your partner so it doesn't actually suck to kill things. Also, if not that maybe make it toggalable by like removing the wedding ring.

It's a bug that could probably cause lag. That's what I think. I don't know if that's the case, but you'd better check

TubshterBratBird said: hi guys, a couple of days ago, I had over 20 iced coffees in my inventory. and today not long ago I noticed they were gone from my inventory and fridge. I thougt I put them in my fridge, and it turns out they weren't in the fridge either. I remember storing some broccoli soup in the fridge, and some fried chicken, and when I opened the fridge, the only things that were in there are the fried chicken. would you guys be able to help my restore back my iced coffees? i'd appreciate any help if possible, if not, that's fine, I can remake those again at some point.

TubshterBratBird said: I cant remember the exact number, I think it was around 25 or so.

Or at least I can do that. But when she tries to do the same thing, along with the filling sound there's some sort of small woosh, and she can only fill one of them, after it's filled the empty bottle goes out of her hand and she drinks from the sink instead.
Ariella said: sure come on

arjun said: I’m building my apartment, but there’s a serious problem. You added the item giver door near the bathroom, yet I can neither see it in the edit line nor build it myself. What’s going on?
You added features like elevators and floors for the building map, but they don’t even work properly! In the map or house builder, some things work fine while others act up like they don’t even belong there — why is that?
The game is supposed to be for entertainment, not for getting frustrated because half of the build items don’t work! Please fix this issue.
And one more thing — please add AI features like animals or robots, something that makes the environment feel more alive, like in real daily life. That would make the game much more realistic and enjoyable.
arjun said: Hi, thanks for your reply.
But I was actually talking about the item giver door, not the taker door.
You already added it near the bathroom, but I can’t see it in the edit line, and I can’t build or place it myself. Please check this issue properly.
Also, I understand that some features are developer-only, but it would be great if at least some items like the item giver door were available for players too — it makes building much more fun and creative.
I’m really enjoying the game, but please make sure all builder items work smoothly and the elevator update in version 2.49 actually fixes these issues. Thanks!
arjun said: yes
arjun said: Haha, yes, I’ve been to a bank — and I totally understand your example!
But just like how banks allow customers to use some limited features (like ATMs or online banking), I think players should also have access to a few limited builder items like the item giver door.
It would make the game more creative and enjoyable for everyone without breaking any system rules.
Anyway, thanks for explaining — I really appreciate your reply and I hope you’ll consider this in future updates! 😊

Robert said: I don't know, I didn't ask, but it's ok, I'll return the bag to her, although to be honest it wouldn't be worth it for what she told me
Robert said: It's ok, I'm not affected by it but I think he should speak nicer. Don't struggle too hard
Robert said: And as proof, I asked her where she was hoping I could go and return her bag and instead of her telling me where it was, she just said "Somewhere". I don't think I'm returning anything anymore.
Robert said: You speak. I have nothing more to discuss after the way he treated me.
Robert said: I'm honestly asking, do you think I broke any rules on this?
hiva said: hi. I have a problem — when I enter the map "Keri's Adventure," all the sounds stop working for me. The footsteps, the bag sounds, basically every sound.

I know that trusted moderators are put, but I thought that they can also be put because they help the team, are active, etc.

Robert said: Yes, but they are not found
Robert said: I mean I don't know where to find them
Robert said: And yet, it would be ok to do something for your health. As a suggestion

dronzer said: hi administrators and developers of this game, I want a news regarding the progress of virsion 2.49. I'm asking this cause it's necessary for me to know, since I'm not having a normel issue in this game, as I'd reported earlyer apart from staff menue not a single menue is properly opening to me before 1 minut or so, and as a rule I asked regarding that here, but I didn't get satisfactory answer, which is why I had to contact the admin team persenally, and I had been assured that everything will be fine after virsion 2.49. so after all the explination my question is the saim when will we have the update, and why is it taking so much time as it's necessary for me? or else should I  completely stop playing the game? or should I completely stop using every menues which is for everyone? cause I'm being treeted unequal here. previous updates were so fast and the one is atached to the over all gaming experience of a player is not coming, I don't know why is it taking so much time to come, since it's manditory for me, as well as to those players who are having the same bug, anyways you tell me, what if you guys have the same problem would you be able to play properly like a normel player? and please don't lie now, if you were not a developer or a staff member you would surely feel annihilated or unequally treeted as a normel player, since you can just sit and chat, no menue is properly working that meens you would not even be able to use teleporter, as well publick, and challange maps. I have been trying to play for 2 days, still it's leading to discouragement for this game. so please I need the update quickly. thanks. 
littleArcher said: help me please my house has broken
littleArcher said: I'm going to edit the map but it crashes.
dronzer said: imagine to wait for 40/50 seconds to bid in an auction, and by the time you get your tirn, the auction is already over, how sad it could be for me as well as you, if you would encounter the saim bug. 
dronzer said: no, not only me, there are 2 more players, makinzy, and one more player, but they probably don't sign in here cause of this bug. 
scorbian2001 said: Hello, I came with the items. How do I put them in the beverage making machine? Selected
littleArcher said: It has no floor and I can't fix it.
littleArcher said: ok
scorbian2001 said: He does not put items in the machine, and what items should I put in it?
dronzer said: then what should I do now, if you tell me to quit the game for this reason, then that could not be a diplomatic answer from you. 
dronzer said: I think you did not check my first message, there I'd explained that not a single menue is properly working apart from /staff, which is useless for me, since it can't help me to play the game, I can't vizits on maps without waiting, can't use teleporters and telehouses, neither /zones are working, nor I can properly even exit, and these are only some issues, you understand not a single menue is properly functioning. developers might be working on the update, but being a player it's very frustrating for me wile deeling with this issue, I haven't done anything wrong, but it's like punishment for me. admin replys: for the auctions, you can disable the  bid agreements and auctions agreements. we are trying to solve it. and its hard to solve when you dont know the cause.
dronzer said: any expected date for the update?

Hanzo said: hi. I understand that the rules state no one should request to become an admin. However, I’d like to mention that I have previous experience serving as an admin in several games, where I created engaging maps and unique items. I believe I could contribute positively to the team, and I’m more than willing to take any test or trial you consider appropriate to demonstrate my abilities.
foxxy said: it still says my inventory is empty.
magnate said: hi admin can you tell me please the carry advanture ninth door answer tell me please please
Hanzo said: "I thought this was a place where requests were allowed and, you know, games were actually free — but sure, let me just sit quietly and wait for the secret council to *observe* who’s “suitable.” Funny thing is, I only made a simple request, and instead of a reply, I got a warning. Guess silence is the new customer service."
Frankenstein said: Hi. There are a lot of redundent sounds in the long road map. Could you fix it?

As problem for  keyboards without  page down  and  page up,  players whos using  this  keyboards, can't use alt+page up for  increase url volume. you can change it to alt +home and end thats easier to do. then it will be:  end and home for  game volume, +shift  = map music volume, and pluss alt = url volume!

Robert said: And another bug, if you bid and then go offline, the auction is cancelled. Is it correct?
Robert said: I mean that's what I've seen happen before, but I honestly forgot to report it. Can you check?
Robert said: Yes, but some can take advantage of this to reset what doesn't suit them
Robert said: I think you should fix this because there may be people who could take advantage

I hope you’re all doing great — both mentally and physically.  
I’ve created a challenging map, and I’d love for it to be added to the list of challenge maps.  
I think a prize of 3,000,000 credits would fit it nicely.  
Could you please take a look at my map and consider adding it?  
Thank you so much!

Moren said: a player with the nickname semsem places high prices in the auction for inexpensive goods
semsem said: Listen Ariella, this is just a game. I have the right to list whatever prices I want, and the user/player can accept or refuse — that’s their choice.
One time a player sold a hamburger sandwich for 300,000,000 — does that even make sense?
So please, let us just play the game without unnecessary excuses or unjustified reasons. There are many players who actually break rules much worse, and in the end this is only a game, not a prison with strict regulations.
If you don’t want me to play, just say so and I will delete the game immediately and find my comfort somewhere else.
semsem said: I understand your point, but I want to clarify something.
I’m not “spamming,” I’m simply playing the game like everyone else. Starting auctions is part of the gameplay, and the prices I choose are my own choice — just like other players list items at extremely high or unrealistic prices all the time.
If some people complained, that does not mean I am breaking rules, especially since no clear rule says what prices are allowed or not.
I never intended to cause problems for anyone, and if a staff member had explained the rules clearly from the beginning, I would have followed them.
I’m here to enjoy the game, not to bother anyone.
If there are specific limits or guidelines, please let me know and I will follow them.
But please don’t accuse me of habits or intentions I don’t have. I just want fair treatment like everyone else.
semsem said: I understand what you’re saying, but I want to clarify my perspective as well.
Yes, some of my auctions don’t get bids — and that’s perfectly fine. That’s how auctions work: sometimes people bid, sometimes they don’t. It doesn’t mean I’m doing anything wrong.
If the prices are too high for players, they simply won’t bid — and that’s exactly what is happening, so the system works as intended.
I’m not forcing anyone, and I’m not harming anyone. I’m just using the auction feature like everyone else.
If there are official rules for pricing or limits that I must follow, please share them clearly and I will follow them.
But if the rules allow players to choose their own prices, then I believe I have the same right as everyone else.
I appreciate your response, and I’m not trying to cause issues. I just want to enjoy the game fairly like any other player.
